- **`get_weightage_optimized_chapter_sequence()`**: Creates optimized chapter sequence for score achievement
- **`save_score_progress()`**: Saves user progress to database

#### New API Endpoints (`app/score_endpoints.py`)
- `POST /score/validate-exam-date`: Validates exam date
- `POST /score/calculate-progress`: Calculates current score progress

- Added score analysis and achievement probability calculations
- Integrated target score validation in workflow

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Context Updates (`src/context/StudyPlanContext.jsx`)
- Added `exam_date` field to initial state

#### API Service Updates (`src/services/api.js`)
- Added `validateExamDate()` function for exam date validation

#### Form Component Updates (`src/components/StudyPlanForm.jsx`)
- Added "Score-Oriented" option to study plan type dropdown
- Added exam date input field with validation
- Implemented real-time exam date validation with 500ms debounce
- Auto-calculation of months based on exam date
- Force preparation type to "revision" for Score-Oriented plans
- Enhanced validation logic for target score and exam date requirements
- Added helpful UI messages and warnings

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

### Score-Oriented Plan Requirements

- **Generator Agent**: Extracts preferences for score optimization
- **Weightage Agent**: Enhanced with score-based prioritization
- **Supervisor Agent**: Validates score-oriented plans
- **Score Analysis**: Provides insights on target achievability

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Flow

1. **Form Selection**: User selects "Score-Oriented" plan type
2. **Target Score Input**: User enters desired score (1-300)
3. **Exam Date Input**: User selects exam date (minimum 5 months ahead)
4. **Auto-Validation**: System validates date and calculates months
5. **Auto-Configuration**: Preparation type set to "revision"
6. **Chat Interaction**: AI counsellor provides score-oriented guidance
7. **Plan Generation**: System creates optimized plan for target score
8. **Score Tracking**: Ongoing progress monitoring and probability updates

## ðŸš€ Technical Highlights

- **Real-time Validation**: Debounced exam date validation
- **Auto-calculation**: Months calculated from exam date
- **Score Optimization**: Weightage-based chapter prioritization
- **Progress Tracking**: Database-backed score monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly messages
- **UI/UX**: Intuitive form with conditional fields and helpful hints

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

### New Tables
- **Score_Progress**: Tracks user score progress
  - user_id, current_score, target_score, completed_chapters
  - achievement_probability, status, last_updated

### Updated Tables
- **User_Table**: Enhanced with exam_date field
- **Form_Content**: Includes exam_date for Score-Oriented plans

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
