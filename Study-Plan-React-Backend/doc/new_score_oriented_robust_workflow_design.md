# New Score-Oriented Robust Workflow Design

## 🎯 **Current Issues Identified**

1. **❌ Auto-generation**: Plan generates without user saying "generate"
2. **❌ Missing requirement extraction**: Not extracting "change target score to 218"
3. **❌ No subject-wise target scores**: Target score not distributed across subjects
4. **❌ Incomplete feedback loop**: Feedback doesn't properly regenerate with requirements
5. **❌ No requirement persistence**: User preferences not stored between interactions

## 🔄 **Proposed Robust Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Initial Requirement Collection**
```
User Input → Requirement Counsellor → Requirement Extractor → Wait for "generate"
```

### **Phase 2: Plan Generation (Only on "generate")**
```
"generate" → Generator Agent → Revision Flow → Enhanced Features → Supervisor → Display → Feedback Collection
```

### **Phase 3: Feedback & Regeneration Loop**
```
User Feedback → Feedback Counsellor → Requirement Extractor → Feedback Supervisor → Wait for "generate" → Regeneration
```

## 📋 **Detailed Workflow Design**

### **1. Requirement Counsellor Agent**
**Purpose**: Collect and acknowledge user requirements without generating

**Responsibilities**:
- Collect user preferences, target scores, subject priorities
- Acknowledge requirements without auto-generating
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Store requirements in state
- Wait for explicit "generate" command

**Example Flow**:
```
User: "change my target score to 218"
Counsellor: "✅ Target score updated to 218/300. Any other preferences?"

User: "focus more on Physics"  
Counsellor: "✅ Physics priority noted. Ready to generate when you say 'generate'"

User: "generate"
Counsellor: "🔄 Generating your plan with all requirements..."
```

### **2. Enhanced Requirement Extractor**
**Purpose**: Extract comprehensive requirements from all chat interactions

**Enhanced Structure**:
```json
{
    "target_score_update": 218,
    "subject_priority": ["physics", "chemistry", "mathematics"],
    "subject_wise_targets": {
        "physics": 80,
        "chemistry": 70, 
        "mathematics": 68
    },
    "chapter_coverage_preferences": {
        "chapters_per_month": 3
    },
    "time_allocation_preferences": {
        "physics": "more",
        "mathematics": "standard"
    },
    "specific_requests": [
        "change target score to 218",
        "focus more on physics"
    ],
    "weak_areas": [],
    "strong_areas": [],
    "study_style_preferences": {},
    "regeneration_reason": "target_score_change"
}
```

### **3. Generator Agent (Enhanced)**
**Purpose**: Generate plan only when user says "generate"

**Process**:
1. Extract all requirements from chat history
2. Calculate subject-wise target distribution
3. Pass requirements to revision flow agent
4. Generate comprehensive plan
5. Route to supervisor for validation

### **4. Feedback Workflow (Enhanced)**
**Purpose**: Collect feedback and regenerate with insights

**Process**:
```
User Feedback → Feedback Counsellor → Requirement Extractor → Feedback Supervisor → User Decision → Regeneration (if requested)
```

## 🛠 **Implementation Plan**

### **Step 1: Create Enhanced Requirement Extractor**
- Extract target score updates
- Calculate subject-wise score distribution
- Handle regeneration context
- Store comprehensive requirements

### **Step 2: Create Requirement Counsellor**
- Collect requirements without generating
- Wait for "generate" command
- Provide requirement summary

### **Step 3: Update Generator Agent**
- Only trigger on "generate"
- Use extracted requirements
- Pass to revision flow with context

### **Step 4: Enhanced Feedback Loop**
- Collect feedback properly
- Extract new requirements
- Provide supervisor analysis
- Regenerate with insights

### **Step 5: Add Subject-wise Target Calculation**
- Distribute total target across subjects
- Consider subject priorities
- Apply to monthly planning

## 🎯 **Expected User Experience**

### **Scenario 1: Initial Plan Creation**
```
User: "I want to score 218 in JEE Mains, focusing more on Physics"
Counsellor: "✅ Requirements noted:
- Target: 218/300
- Priority: Physics focus
Say 'generate' when ready!"

User: "generate"
Generator: "🔄 Creating plan with your requirements..."
[Plan generated with Physics priority and 218 target]
```

### **Scenario 2: Plan Modification**
```
User: "change my target score to 218"
Feedback Counsellor: "I understand you want to change your target score to 218. Getting expert analysis..."
Supervisor: [Provides analysis of score change impact]
User: "implement changes"
Generator: "🔄 Regenerating with new target score..."
[Plan regenerated with 218 target]
```

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Requirements**
```
User: "change target to 218 and include 3 chapters per month"
Feedback Counsellor: "Requirements extracted:
- Target score: 218/300
- Chapter coverage: 3 chapters/month
Getting expert analysis..."
Supervisor: [Analyzes both changes]
User: "generate"
Generator: "🔄 Creating plan with all requirements..."
```

## 📊 **Subject-wise Target Distribution Logic**

### **Default Distribution (Equal)**
- Physics: 218/3 = 72.67 ≈ 73
- Chemistry: 218/3 = 72.67 ≈ 73  
- Mathematics: 218/3 = 72.67 ≈ 72

### **Priority-based Distribution**
If "focus more on Physics":
- Physics: 80 (higher allocation)
- Chemistry: 70 (standard)
- Mathematics: 68 (adjusted)

### **Weightage-based Distribution**
Based on JEE Mains weightage:
- Physics: 218 × 0.33 = 72
- Chemistry: 218 × 0.33 = 72
- Mathematics: 218 × 0.34 = 74

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **New Tools Needed**:
1. `enhanced_requirement_extractor_tool`
2. `subject_target_calculator_tool`
3. `requirement_counsellor_tool`
4. `feedback_requirement_merger_tool`

### **Enhanced Agents**:
1. `requirement_counsellor_agent`
2. `enhanced_generator_agent`
3. `enhanced_feedback_supervisor_agent`

### **State Management**:
```python
state = {
    "user_requirements": {
        "target_score_update": 218,
        "subject_wise_targets": {...},
        "all_preferences": {...}
    },
    "generation_triggered": False,
    "feedback_context": {...},
    "supervisor_analysis": {...}
}
```
