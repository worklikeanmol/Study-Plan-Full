# LangGraph Debugging and Fixes for Study Plan Backend
# Issues identified and solutions

"""
MAJOR ISSUES FOUND IN YOUR LANGGRAPH IMPLEMENTATION:

1. AGENT INVOCATION PROBLEMS:
   - Some agents are not being invoked properly
   - Missing error handling for agent failures
   - Inconsistent state management

2. WORKFLOW ROUTING ISSUES:
   - Some conditional edges may fail
   - Missing state validation
   - Improper next_agent setting

3. STATE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS:
   - Some nodes don't properly initialize state
   - Missing required state fields
   - Inconsistent state updates

4. MISSING NODES:
   - Some referenced nodes are not implemented
   - Missing imports for external agents

Let me provide the fixes:
"""

# ISSUE 1: Missing imports and undefined agents
# You're referencing agents that aren't imported or defined

# ADD THESE IMPORTS AT THE TOP OF graph.py:
missing_imports = """
# Add these imports to the top of your graph.py file:
from app.new_score_oriented.agents import (
    revision_flow_agent, 
    new_score_oriented_validator, 
    new_score_oriented_supervisor
)
"""

# ISSUE 2: Agent nodes that are referenced but not implemented
missing_nodes = """
MISSING NODE IMPLEMENTATIONS:

1. score_oriented_validator_node - Referenced but not implemented
2. revision_flow_node - Referenced but not implemented  
3. new_score_oriented_* nodes - Referenced but not implemented

These nodes are added to the workflow but the functions don't exist!

# ISSUE 3: State initialization problems
state_issues = """
STATE INITIALIZATION ISSUES:

1. Some nodes don't initialize required state fields
2. Missing default values for state fields
3. Inconsistent state field names

Example fixes needed:
- Ensure all nodes set state["next_agent"] 
- Initialize empty lists/dicts for missing fields
- Validate state before processing

# COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOW EXPLANATION
workflow_explanation = """
=== CURRENT WORKFLOW STRUCTURE ===

Your LangGraph workflow follows this path:

1. ENTRY POINT: counsellor
   ↓
2. ROUTING: Based on user input
   - "generate" → generator
   - continue conversation → counsellor_continue → END
   
3. GENERATOR: Extracts preferences and routes to:
   - Custom + Syllabus Coverage → flow
   - Custom + Revision → weightage
   - Score-oriented → score_oriented_validator (BROKEN)
   - New Score-oriented → revision_flow (BROKEN)
   
4. FLOW/WEIGHTAGE: Calculate study plan
   ↓
5. TOPIC: Generate weekly topics
   ↓
6. GENERATOR_COLLATE: Combine results
   ↓
7. SUPERVISOR: Validate plan
   ↓
8. COUNSELLOR_FINAL: Present plan
   ↓
9. FEEDBACK_COUNSELLOR: Handle user feedback
   - "finalize" → END
   - changes → feedback_supervisor → feedback_counsellor_continue

=== BROKEN NODES IDENTIFIED ===

1. score_oriented_validator_node - Uses undefined score_validator
2. revision_flow_node - Uses undefined revision_flow_agent  
3. new_score_oriented_* nodes - Use undefined new_score_oriented_validator
4. Missing imports for external agents

=== FIXES APPLIED ===

1. Added try-catch blocks to all problematic nodes
2. Added fallback routing when agents are unavailable
3. Proper state validation before processing
4. Error handling to prevent workflow crashes

# FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
recommendations = """
=== IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED ===

1. REMOVE BROKEN NODES from workflow:
   - Comment out or remove these lines from workflow definition:
     workflow.add_node("score_oriented_validator", score_oriented_validator_node)
     workflow.add_node("revision_flow", revision_flow_node)
     workflow.add_node("new_score_oriented_*", ...)

2. UPDATE GENERATOR ROUTING:
   - Remove references to broken nodes in generator_node
   - Route all plans through flow/weightage based on preparation_type

3. SIMPLIFY WORKFLOW:
   - For now, use only: counsellor → generator → flow/weightage → topic → generator_collate → supervisor → counsellor_final → feedback_counsellor

=== WORKING WORKFLOW FOR CUSTOM PLANS ===

counsellor (collect preferences)
    ↓ "generate"
generator (extract preferences)
    ↓ syllabus coverage
flow (dependency-based planning)
    ↓
topic (weekly breakdown)
    ↓
generator_collate (combine results)
    ↓
supervisor (validate)
    ↓
counsellor_final (present plan)
    ↓
feedback_counsellor (handle feedback)
    ↓ "finalize"
END

=== NEXT STEPS ===

1. Test the basic workflow with Custom + Syllabus Coverage
2. Fix any remaining state issues
3. Add proper error logging
4. Implement missing agents later when needed
